<a id="about"></a>
<p class= "abouttext">Bridging the fields of anthropology, computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and ICTD (Information Communication Technologies &amp; Development),&nbsp;I use qualitative methods to study how underrepresented groups collaboratively access and participate with information communication technologies (ICTs) in politically and resource-constrained societies. Drawing on my training as a sociocultural anthropologist, my work investigates (1) internet access in resource-constrained regions;&nbsp;(2) the design of citizen-led information systems; and (3) social media use for social change.
I received my Ph.D. in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. My dissertation analyzed how individuals in Havana, Cuba, collaboratively piece together multiple information infrastructures to create a uniquely “Cuban” internet against the backdrop of prohibitive access to the world wide web.
At Georgia Tech, I was advised by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Amy.Bruckman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Bruckman</a> and <a href="http://nehakumar.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neha Kumar</a>&nbsp;and was a member of the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/elc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELC Lab</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandem.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TanDem Lab</a>.&nbsp; I am also a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellow.
I have&nbsp;a Master’s degree in anthropology from Georgia State University, specializing in cultural and digital anthropology. My <a href="http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> examined the use of Facebook for impression management and political activism by diasporic Hispanic groups. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Spanish from the University of Georgia, where my studies centered on Spanish media and culture.
In between getting my degrees, I worked as a social media and public relations manager at organizations including Georgia Tech, Georgia Aquarium, Northside Hospital, and Cohen Wolfe. I’ve also worked as a private social media consultant for individuals, non-profits, and small businesses.
I enjoy collaborating with researchers across a variety of disciplines to examine engagements with digital technologies among traditionally underrepresented groups. I am particularly interested in qualitative research methods, social computing, HCI4D, information communication technologies and development (ICTD), internet access interventions, hyper-local information infrastructures, e-democracy, activism through social media, and the virtual public sphere.
I also enjoy exploring remote places, throwing impromptu dance parties, reading historical fiction, and playing with all kinds of animals.</p><br>
